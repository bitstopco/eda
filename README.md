## About üëã

Onyx::EDA is an [Event-Driven Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture) framework. It allows to emit certain *events* and subscribe to them.

It has several *channels* implemented:

* [In-memory channel](https://api.onyxframework.org/eda/Onyx/EDA/Channel.html)
* [Redis channel](https://api.onyxframework.org/eda/Onyx/EDA/Channel/Redis.html) (working on [Redis streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro))

## Installation üì•

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  onyx-eda:
    github: onyxframework/eda
    version: ~> 0.2.0
```

This shard follows [Semantic Versioning v2.0.0](http://semver.org/), so check [releases](https://github.com/onyxframework/rest/releases) and change the `version` accordingly. Please visit [github.com/crystal-lang/shards](https://github.com/crystal-lang/shards) to know more about Crystal shards.

## Usage üíª

First of all, you need to create a channel:

```crystal
require "onyx-eda"
channel = Onyx::EDA::Channel.new

# or
#

require "onyx-eda"
require "onyx-eda/channel/redis"

channel = Onyx::EDA::Channel::Redis.new("redis://localhost:6379")
```

Then define events to emit:

```crystal
struct MyEvent
  include Onyx::EDA::Event

  getter foo

  def initialize(@foo : String)
  end
end
```

Subscribe an object to the event:

```crystal
# Top-level subscription
channel.subscribe(Object, MyEvent) do |event|
  pp event.foo
end

# Object-level subscriptions
#

class Notifier
  def initialize(channel)
    channel.subscribe(self, MyEvent) do |event|
      pp event.foo
    end
  end
end

notifier = Notifier.new(channel)
```

Then emit the event:

```crystal
channel.emit(MyEvent.new("bar"))
```

All subscribers will asynchronously notified of the new event. You can then unsubscribe:

```crystal
channel.unsubscribe(notifier)
```

### Using with Onyx top-level macros

[Onyx](https://github.com/onyxframework/onyx) shard has convenient macros to reduce boilerplate code. Once [`"onyx/eda"`](https://github.com/onyxframework/onyx#eda) is required, a singleton `Onyx.channel` is defined. You can then specify which channel to use, for example, `Onyx.channel(:redis)`.

```crystal
require "onyx/eda"

struct MyEvent
  # ditto
end

Onyx.channel(:redis)

Onyx.subscribe(Object, MyEvent) do |event|
  # ditto
end

Onyx.emit(MyEvent.new("bar"))
# or
Onyx.channel.emit(MyEvent.new("bar"))

sleep(0.1)

Onyx.unsubscibe(Object)
```
